# Generics MicroLabs
The microlabs for the Generics chapter are all grouped together.  So, you need to work through them package by package.
The following list is the package name followed by a quick description of the assignment.
1. StackArrayList -- Implement `Stack<E>` to use an ArrayList as a stack.  You need to make the `push`, `pop`, and
`isEmpty` functions.
2. StackArray -- Implement `Stack<E>` to use an array as a stack.  You'll need to potentially grow the array in the 
`push` method.  Do this first with an `E[]` array, and then again with an `Object[]` array.  Both should compile
without warnings and pass the tests.
